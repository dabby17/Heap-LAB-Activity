Introduction of Medical App
            This medical app uses a priority queue to manage the  patient personal information based on urgency. This simple example but  real world medical system would be far more involved, with strong error handling, data validation and maybe database interaction.


Describe the Medical App
             In a real-world medical context, a more sophisticated system would manage incoming patients or tasks using a priority queue (heap). Priority can be established by factors such as vital signs, symptoms, waiting time, and test findings, including urgent results.


Why did you make that kind of application? How does it contribute to you or to the community?
           This sort of application seeks to improve efficiency and patient care in a medical setting by prioritizing patients depending on their need. It helps to streamline workflows and reduce essential care delays. A real-world implementation of such an application would contribute to the community in the following ways: Prioritizing urgent patients can lead to timely treatment and higher survival rates.Faster treatment can improve patient outcomes by reducing complications. And improving efficiency and allocating resources effectively minimizes wait times and enhances hospital workflow.
